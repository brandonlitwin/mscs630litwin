My work for MSCS630 - Security Algorithms and Protocols

Check out the `prj` folder to see 5 different Java labs I worked on that demonstrate different security algorithms.
The inner folder `semester_project` is a Python Flask project that demonstrates how AES can encrypt and decrypt messages sent between users
as well as show how a simple weakness in a system can weaken its entire security.
